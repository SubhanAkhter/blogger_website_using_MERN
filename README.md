   cd blogger_website_using_MERN
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   For the backend:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

   For the frontend:

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the backend directory and add the necessary environment variables. Refer to the `.env.example` for required fields.

5. **Run the application:**

   Start the backend server:

   ```bash
   cd backend

## 🔗 API Endpoints

### User Authentication

- **POST** `/api/auth/register`: Register a new user
- **POST** `/api/auth/login`: Log in an existing user

### Blog Operations

- **GET** `/api/blogs`: Retrieve all blogs
- **GET** `/api/blogs/:id`: Retrieve a specific blog by ID
- **POST** `/api/blogs`: Create a new blog
- **PUT** `/api/blogs/:id`: Update an existing blog
- **DELETE** `/api/blogs/:id`: Delete a blog

## 📦 Frontend Components

The frontend is built using React components. Here are some key components:

- **App.js**: Main application component
- **Header.js**: Navigation bar
- **BlogList.js**: Displays a list of blogs
- **BlogForm.js**: Form for creating and editing blogs
- **Login.js**: User login component
- **Register.js**: User registration component
- **Contact.js**: Contact page component

## 🔒 User Authentication

User authentication is handled through JWT (JSON Web Tokens). When a user registers or logs in, they receive a token that they can use to access protected routes. The backend verifies this token to ensure that the user is authenticated.

### Registration

To register, users must provide a username, email, and password. The server hashes the password before storing it in the database.

### Login

During login, users provide their credentials. If they match the records, the server generates a token for the user.

## 🖼️ Image Upload

This application uses Multer for handling image uploads. Users can upload images when creating or editing blog posts. The images are stored on the server, and their URLs are saved in the database.

## 📱 Responsive Design

The UI is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on both mobile and desktop devices. CSS media queries are used to adjust styles based on the screen size.
